Mobs
---------
Fk rarity mobs and go with levels? Reasons:
+ better flexibility
+ makes the game more interesting to explore higher level locations
+ better scales into late game, where I want to increase level cap by 5-10 levels, so I can just add new mobs
- maybe a bit harder to design all initial mobs


Each mob will have defined their stat multiplier which will be multiplied by
base stats and level of the spawned mob. Maybe I don't even need a stat multiplier
and just define few types of mobs for simplicity.

There will definitely be types of mobs.

4story type of mobs
- agressive/defensive
- melee, ranged

Taming
- agressive, defensive, passive
- all melee + ability

My game
- behavior = agressive, defensive, passive
- range = melee, ranged

Mob types
- each mob has min and max level

Item flow
---------
- player has owned items stored in database and currently equipped items as another property
- when player joins the game trough api play route, api loads their data and send it to instance server,
  which creates new player in "connectingPlayers". When players gets connected to the instance server, player gets moved
  from "connectingPlayers" to "players". 
- after player gets connected (or when data is sent to instance server)
  - stats from equipped items get calculated
  - items with functionality (action bar items - weapons and spells) get instantiated
    - there will be two separated properties for this, equippedItems like in database and
      action bar items which consists of instantiated equipped items
    


- when player joins the game, all currently equipped items get instantiated based on the id

Example: id = "mythic-daggers"

...

DATABASE ITEMS
- materials
  - consists of item id as key and material object as value. For now the only property will be "amount". This is done for flexibility
  - info about material will be obtained trough game data
- equip 
  - consists of unique item id as key and item info as value 
    (in game item id, rarity, upgradeLevel and later maybe some other info such as bonuses, etc)
  - no subcategories, such as weapon, armor, etc., because I don't want to make the database reliant on game logic
    and this could cause problems when deciding whether to split weapons into
    primary and secondary. Also instance server wont be looping trough players items.
    This is a job that will be handled by client when displaying equip items, so it doesn't
    have to be perfectly optimized.

databaseItems = {
  materials: {
    "material-id": { amount: 100 }
  },
  equip: {
    "uniqueId": {
      itemId: "daggers",
      rarity: "legendary",
      upgradeLevel: 3
    }
  }
}

----

Equip Items
- all items have rarities and upgradeLevels

(3 left side)
- armor
- accessory (feather, horns, etc.)
- wings

(3 right side)
- necklace
- earring
- ring

(2 bottom)
- primary weapon
- secondary weapon

....

Fk item rarities and keep it simple?

Items will have only upgradeLevels. In the beginning there will be only one asset for each
item type regardless of upgradeLevel. Later on I can visually change the item based on upgradeLevel? 

Skill trees
In terms of skill trees I want to have very customizable builds. 
Each skill tree will allow player to wear only specific equipment.
E.g. Fire mage only allows to equip fire rod as primary weapon and no secondary weapon.


Stats
- strength
- dexterity
- intelligence
- wisdom


Main weapon list (The issue here is that the are too many melee weapons and only little bit of ranged weapons)
- daggers (dex)
- sword (str)
- spear (str)
- double axes (str)
- greatsword (str)
- katana (dex)
- bow (dex)
- rod (int)
- wand (wis)

Skilltrees/Classes
- Warrior (sword + shield)
- Archer (daggers + bow)
- Mage (rod)
- Priest

Actaully Im gonna go for flexibility and build around it.

Primary weapons
- daggers
- sword
- rod

Secondary weapons
- bow
- shield

NEW IDEA
I just thought about one big balancing issue. When I want to change the cost of certain spell,
I need to either reset all players skill trees or recalculate their points which is a big issue.

So what I want to do is to make spells as obtainable items. It makes a lot of sense as spell can be
grinded for. 

Now I need to somehow balance the individual spells so that players don't equip full skillbar of
op spells. So what comes to my mind is implementing long cast times for op spells.

Also spells will be bound to individual weapons, so it won't be that player can sudenly use 3 stuns in a row.
Stuns for example will be bound to weapons.

Question is, do I introduce infinite amount of slots, or do I limit them? I probably limit them right? Because
there will be things like buildings, so if player had 20 slots he can cast several spells but use building at the same
time. So it makes sense to limit the custom slots to about 8?

Also I like the idea of skill tree. But it will be a very generic one just like in Florr. It will emphasize on specialization,
whether the player wants to go for damage, tankiness, strong buildings, strong pets, etc.

---

Ok so the idea is to make different builds highly customizable with a lot of spells (unlimited slots) just like in wow
and limit the usage to cast times. Insta cast spells might cause a few issues, but they will be limited. For example archer
will have onle few insta cast arrows. Now how do I balance dexterity build with daggers and bow, since it will be possible to combine
two classes - assassin and archer if I make unlimited slots. So ig I limit the slots to a big amount to force the player to choose
what they want to go for.

TLDR. about 8 customizable slots for spells with a lot of options seems good.

Now how do I balance pets/mounts in the future? Maybe I 

Slots
- primary weapon
- secondary weapon
- 5-8 spells
- later on extra slot for tools

SKILL SETS
Bow (Daggers + Bow)
- Shot 1
- Shot 2
- Shot 3
- Shot 4

Build goals

Tank

Assassin

Archer

Priest

Mage (fire mage)
- AOE vortex
- AOE fireball or smth
- AOE stun (fear)
- 2-3 single target spells
- slow, silence
- tp

Builder
- walls, doors, turrets, etc.

---

Anyways these are all balancing details that can i back into later. 

The idea is there will be following equipment:
- armor
- accessory
- wings

- 3 jewel equip items (necklace/belt/earring/ring/talisman/idk)

- primary weapon
- secondary weapon

Player will have following slots to use
- primary weapon
- secondary weapon
- 8 spells

There will be 4 basic stats which will determine players play style (???? not sure yet)
- strength (tanky, less mobile, still has plenty of dmg)
- dexterity (high dps, high mobility, squishy)
- intelligence
- wisdom

Now I need to figure out how does player obtain spells.
It will probably be the best if player has to grind for them and doesn't
simply unlock them with skill points from level. This way player can collect
all spells in-game.

TODO: figure out how does player unlock spells - what resources does he need for what?

---

Player will be able to obtain equip/spells/mounts two ways. They either buy them in shop
for premium currency(p2w, ads, daily challenges) or they craft them.

All items will be craftable from a crafting menu. 
Crafting menu will have two primary categories - equip and abilities.

Abilities can be done real simple. There will be one resource dropable by all types of mobs.
Smth like "knowledge essence". It will be the primary resource used to learn/craft abilities.
Later on rare abilities will also cost other resources to upgrade dropable by specific type of mobs.

Difference between abilities and other items is that ability can be made only once,
while other items can be created infinitely.

The issue is how do I balance craftable weapons? I planned to have only 1 item for each category
for simplicity. For example there will be only one bow. How do I make it so that it makes sense
to craft?

Maybe I make it the same way like with abilities? Player unlocks the weapon only once and then he upgrades
it from the crafting menu? ... I don't like this solution because it limits the player from being able
to use weaker equipment. I want equipment to be fully customizable.

Ok so maybe there will be different grades of item. And then each item will have its own category?
For example category is "sword". And there will be multiple swords. Question is, how do I differentiate
them? There will for sure be basic starting weapons for each category (maybe except advanced ones like rod, wand, etc.).

---

Abilities will have its own modal window. There will be ability modal and crafting modal. 

Abilities will be simple. The modal will have two categories - learn ability, learned abilities (better name needed).
In learn ability player can click on the ability and learn it if they have enough resources.
Once they learn it, they can drag the ability to their actions bar, which will instantiate it. They can also upgrade
the ability if they have enough resources and level.

Now I need to figure out how is the crafting part gonna work.

---

All equip items need their purpose. If a mob drops certain item, it has to be useful smh.

Other games:

4story
- "uselles" items are sold for silver or magic equipment can be used to transfer its effect to players item
- lvl system is kinda dumb, since all items under lvl 34 are uselles. Useful only to get to 34 which is far from max level
- basic principle = someone starts with low lvl items, then gets to 34 items, then saves material for pvp items

weapon
lvl 1
lvl 7
lvl 16
lvl 25
lvl 34
pvp 34

WOW
- "uselles" items are sold for gold
- good items are obtained from drops (maybe crafting)
- everything scales, which is dumb

BDO
- "uselles" items can be used to recover durability or can be heated for materials or sold for silver
- different type of equip, everything of equipable from lvl 0


---

My solution has to be asset independant for simpicity. 
Different assets will be used for skins.
It has to work with only one asset for each equip item.
Strength of item can be determined by its color.

---

The low level items will have fixed color, while best grade (or also best-1 grade) items,
will have the option to change the color (???). But then I also need the flexbility to
increase the max upgrade level.

---

Example I came up with:
- stone sword (lvl 1)
- golden sword (lvl 15)
- 
- quartz sword

...idk

---

Ok fk it. I have been thinking about this for 3 hours straight now 
and making item strength based on some color (rarity/mineral) makes me so
depressed and unmotivated. Because I want the game to be highly customizable
with skins. If I make the best items in one color, then there is not flexbility
in customization. So I sabotage this concept.

---

Just tried replacing individual pixels of an image and it is very expensive
operation. So this is definitely no go and color variations of an item will be
all different images.

--- 

Been thinking about upgrade system. Every item is gonna have value. 
The important part is that value of equip items will go up exponentionaly
while value of drops will go up linearly. This means that upgrading equip
will be easy at first but will get harder over time.
I really like this idea, since it motivates player to go kill stronger mobs
to get better loot, while the theres bigger and bigger need for loot the further
player progresses.
