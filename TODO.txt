----------------------------------------------------------
NEXT SESSION
----------------------------------------------------------
- add prettier configs to all projects (maybe root will be enough?)



----------------------------------------------------------
MAP EDITOR
----------------------------------------------------------
- fix space between tiles during rendering 
  - happens cause of rounding (camera transform and scale)

- texture rendering on non-wall tiles
  - render if tile value ==== 1 or if atleast one adjanced tile has value of 1 (not corner ones).
    Need to make separate variable for this, so that it doesn't get computed during render.
    So I have to either remake tiles into array of objects or maybe make another data structure? 
  - start with rendering solid bg to test if the condition is right

- combine get walls and mesh vertices into a single method?
- debug configuration index of a square
- debug square nodes
- marching squares linear interpolation

----------------------------------------------------------
ANIMATOR
----------------------------------------------------------
- fix endless download if api not available

- await asset download in editor

- design keyframes in KeyframesPlayground

- handle canvas resize (when resizing columns)
- add resizable columns to localStorage

- move "Copy JSON" to context menu and style the context menu

- start with top bar styling after comeback
  - need to display current object name somewhere
  
- display parts hitbox on hover




- ability to move/rotate/etc. parts in viewport
  - three edit modes - move (W), scale (S), rotate (R) - issue: asset rotation and rotation
- better asset pivot point edit mode
  - "adjust" button in inspector next to "change asset" that opens new window in viewport
    that allows to adjust assets rotation and pivot point
  - maybe integrate the feature directly into viewport
  - maybe implement asset rotation into viewport next to rotation and another viewport tab
    will have exclusively editor for the pivot points.
  - or the asset rotation option can be both in viewport and new edit asset tab

- prepare for the ability to add skins. All player objects will need to have
  customized properties for each skin. So need to prepare for that.

----------------------------------------------------------
GAME
----------------------------------------------------------
- render equipped armor/wings/accessory
- add wings

- equip/unequip item with button
  - clicking one item will select it, which will conditionally render buttons
    - equipped item - unequip btn
    - equipped item - equip btn

----------------------------------------------------------
OTHER
----------------------------------------------------------
- menu component (like q-menu)

- api.ts types
- select label

- style checkbox

- tooltip handle overflow

- test app in other browser
  - for example Firefox is gonna have issues with components like Slider, 
    cause of input range appearance

- small variant for checkbox

- refactor to tailwind, because having css in separate file is getting painful
